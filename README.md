# Company Staff System - C++ Project

## Overview

This C++ project is a company staff management system that allows you to manage employee data efficiently. The system uses an array of structs to store employee information, including their name, ID, age, gender, and salary. It provides various functions for loading, saving, updating, and manipulating employee data.

## Components

### Arrays/Arrays of Structs in Use

- **Struct Definition**: `company`
  - `string name`: Employee name
  - `string id`: Employee ID
  - `int age`: Employee age
  - `string gender`: Employee gender
  - `int salary`: Employee salary

### List of Function Prototypes (Headers)

1. `void LoadData(string fName, company employees[])`
   - Loads employee data from the input file.
   
2. `void backup(string fName, string bName)`
   - Copies the data from the input file to a backup file.

3. `void saveData(string oName, company employees[])`
   - Saves the modified data to an output file.

4. `void statistical_report()`
   - Creates an output file containing a statistical report.

5. `int test(company employees[], string id, int NumOfEmployees)`
   - Overloaded function for testing purposes.

6. `int test()`
   - Overloaded function for testing purposes.

7. `void welcome()`
   - Displays a welcome message.

8. `void menu()`
   - Displays the system menu.

9. `void displayData(company employees[])`
   - Displays the current employee data.

10. `void add(company employees[], int &NumOfEmployees)`
    - Adds a new staff member.

11. `int search(company employees[], string id, int NumOfEmployees)`
    - Searches for a specific staff member by ID.

12. `void update(company employees[], string id, int NumOfEmployees)`
    - Updates the salary and age of a specific staff member.

13. `void sort(company employees[], int NumOfEmployees)`
    - Sorts employee data.

14. `void DeleteData(company employees[], string id, int &NumOfEmployees)`
    - Deletes a record of a specific staff member.

### Files Used

- **Input File**: `Data.txt`
  - Contains the initial employee data.

- **Backup Output File**: `Data_backup.txt`
  - A copy of the input file for backup purposes.

- **Output File**: `New_Data.txt`
  - Where the modified employee data is saved.

- **Statistical Report File**: `Statical_Report.txt`
  - Contains the statistical report generated by the system.

## Getting Started

To start using the company staff management system, follow these steps:

1. Compile and run the C++ program.
2. Use the menu to perform various operations on employee data.
3. The system will load data from `Data.txt` on startup.
4. You can make changes and save the updated data to `New_Data.txt`.
5. A statistical report will be generated and saved in `Statical_Report.txt`.

Remember to adjust file paths if needed, and make sure that the input data file (`Data.txt`) exists before running the program.

Enjoy managing your company's staff data with this system!
